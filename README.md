North America Divided (NAD) is an alternate history modification for Hearts of Iron IV set in an alternate 1936. Following the Great Depression and the Second Great War, the traditional powerhouses of North America - the United States, Canada, and Mexico - have collapsed into fragmented successor states. 

In this timeline, the Great Depression hit harder than ever before. The U.S. states grew increasingly distrustful of the federal government, and many decided that self-rule was preferable to remaining within the crumbling United States. How will you lead your favorite state, province, or territory into this era of uncertainty?

## Features

- **Complete North American Map**: A fully detailed map covering all of North America
- **20+ Playable Nations**: Choose from numerous successor states and territories
- **Immersive Gameplay**: Challenging and engaging mechanics tailored for the North American setting
- **Realistic Lore**: Sensible alternate history with believable political and economic developments
- **Custom Content**: Unique national focuses, events, and gameplay mechanics for each nation

## Gameplay

Experience the collapse and rebuilding of North America through:
- Strategic state management in a post-collapse environment
- Diplomatic relations between former allies turned rivals
- Economic reconstruction and political stabilization
- Military conflicts over resources and territory
